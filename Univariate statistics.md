# Parametric and non-parametric statistics
Parametric stastistics *relies on assumption about a general family of distribution*, whereas non parametric allows you to proceed withouth these assumptions. It comes with a price: the number of measurements required to get significative results is higher in the non-parametric case. 

## How can I assume a particular family of distributions?
1. In most cases, this assumption can be made for domain-knowledge.
2. If I want to inspect my data in order to check if a distribution is appropriate, there are different tools ([[Graphical tools for detecting data distribution]], [[Quantitative tools for detecting data distribution]])
