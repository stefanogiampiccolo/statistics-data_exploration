Multivariate data visualization is obviously difficult: this is a problem because **seeing** is the first step to detect a structure in your dataset.

# Methods to visualize multivariate datasets
There are at least three different ways to visualize multivariate datasets with $n$ samples:

1. **Distance matrix** : a $n \times n$ (symmetric) matrix displaying distances between samples
2. **Projections** on lower dimension spaces
3. **Grouping** in some way the samples

## Projections
See [[Feature projection]].

## Grouping
See [[Clustering techniques]].
