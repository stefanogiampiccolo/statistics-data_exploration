# Pros and cons of multivariate analysis

## Pros 
Taking **correlation** between variables into account (multivariate distribution). The **structure of the phenomenon** I want to model could be more visible

## Cons
1. [[Curse of dimensionality]]: I can easily find a structure in my data just by chance. 
2. [[Multivariate data visualization]] is harder than univariate data visualization.
