The mainly goal of data analysis is discover a structure in the data than can be generalized on unobserved cases. 

# Univariate and multivariate
[[Univariate data analysis]] and [[Multivariate data analysis]] differs in the way they are dealing with multiple variables in your data, considering or not their multivariate structure and distribution.

# Data missingness 
One of the major and more intense problems of data analysis is the manual curation of tables and datasets.
An issue frequent with data is missigness, that is particularly important when it comes to multivariate data analysis.

See [[Techniques to deal with missing data]].

# Data visualization
*Seeing the data* is the first most important step in data analysis. The main reasons are:
1. *statistically significant results* will be *visible* in the raw data
2. *errors* in pre/processing will be *visible* in the raw data
3. my *eye* is a sort of *protrusion of my brain*

See the [[Data visualization]] section.
