**Def**: The number of features can impact on your data analysis techniques. It is often desirable to reduce the number of input features. This reduces the number of dimensions of the feature space, hence the name “_dimensionality reduction_.”

A popular approach to dimensionality reduction is to use projections, often called **feature projection**. See [[Feature projection]].
